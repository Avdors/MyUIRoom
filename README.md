# To be effective we need to keep ourselves interested in our tasks, this will keep us from burning out!
 This matrix divides your tasks into 4 groups:
 * Urgent/Important: Do
 * Not Urgent/Important: Schedule
 * Urgent/Not Important: Delegate
 * Not Urgent/Not Important: Delete
# Prioritizing leads to action

The main application window is divided into 4 RecyclerView lists, each window displays a specific type of task. Request notification permissions, 
Notify each task depending on its completion date, the notification has actions that can be used to move the completion date to the next day or finish the task.
We can drag and drop a task between different RecyclerViews, this will change the task type and update the data in the database.
I use Room to work with the database. Google authentication is set up, each user can have a different task list on the same phone.
To each task can be attached a list of files, files are stored in internal storage, when you delete a task, the space is released.
The text of the task description can be entered using voice input. It is possible to share a task in the form of text, in the set format -
"Task name" transferring the line "Task description". LottieFiles animation is used during task execution.
In the list of tasks you can track the tasks that are due soon.
